The CurrentUserLoader that we created passed the current user inside its props.
The main drawback with this appraoch is that it is very restricted in what it is capable of doing.
As what this CurrentUserLoader does is load a single user and passes it to its children, 
and the single user is the current user that we are loading from the server.

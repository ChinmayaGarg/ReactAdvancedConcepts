The CurrentUserLoader that we created passed the current user inside its props.
The main drawback with this appraoch is that it is very restricted in what it is capable of doing.
As what this CurrentUserLoader does is load a single user and passes it to its children, 
and the single user is the current user that we are loading from the server. 

Solution is to modify the CurrentUserLoader component so that instead of just loading the current user, 
it is able to load any user we want by their ID. Instead of modifying CurrentUserLoader, we will create a new file
UserLoader.js and will edit in it.

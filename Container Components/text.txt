CONTAINER COMPONENT
Components that take care of loading and managing data for their child Components.
Example:
    Let's say we have a following setup. A container component with several child component in it.
    <ContainerComponent>
        <Child1 />
        <Child2 />
        <Child3 />
    </ContainerComponent>

Generally what developers do is they have each of the child components load their own data and display it as below.
const Child1 = () =>{
    // load data
    return (
        // display the data
    )
}

Problem with above general logic is, lot of the time we need our child components to be able to share that logic.
Container Components solve this problem is by splitting that logic (load data logic) out into its own component which is the container.
The container then takes care of loading that data and passess it automatically to the children components.

IDEA OF CONTAINER COMPONENT
We don't want our child components of container component to know where their data is coming from or how to manage it.
We want our child components to be duumb and take some props and display whatever they need to display.

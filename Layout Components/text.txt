What are Layout Components?
React Components that deal primarily with arranging other components on the page.
Their primary concern is to help us arrange other components that we create on the page.
    Examples:
    1. Split Screens: Arranging more than one component in different sections of the page.
    2. List & Items: Displaying data in a List etc.
    3. Modals: The content that gets displayed over top of the actual page.

Basic Idea about Layout Components:
Normally, when we create a component like side navigation for our site (i.e. just abar on LHS that contains some links).

We generally create side navigation using the div and the styles that go with the side nav inside the component itself.
<div styles={...}>
    <h1>Component Code...</h1>
</div>

However, with Layout Components we split the actual layout styles into their own components, and then simply display the component itself,
in this case the side nav, inside that layout component. 
What it does is, it separates the component itself from where the component is being displayed on the page, and 
it gives a lot more flexibility for how to use it in the future.

LAYOUT COMPONENT
<div styles={...}>
    {children}
</div>

SIDE NAV
<>
<h1>Component Code...
</>

IDEA OF LAYOUT Components
The main idea of Layout Components is that, our components that we create, the main content components of our pages,
should not know where they are being displayed on the page.

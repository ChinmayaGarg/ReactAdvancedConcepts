We will be learning/implementing Advanced Design Patterns in React.

What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are "effective" solutions to common application development challenges.
Effective is emphasized because there are a lot of solutions to different problems that are not effective,
and lead to more brittle code down the line making apps less performant and less maintainable. These are generally
referred to as "anti-patterns". "Design patterns" are positive equivalent of "anti-patterns"

Caveat: 
    1. The design patterns we talk about in this course are not the Gang of Four OOP design patterns such as creational, behavioral patterns etc.
    2. The design patterns we cover here are effective solutions to some extremely common challenges in React.
       Some of these challenges includes things like:
        a. Creating reusable layouts to put our components into.
        b. How to make things like split screen and modals.
        c. Reusing Complex logic between multiple components. 
            (If we have 2 or more components to do the same complex things such as load data from server, 
            how do we best represent that in our react apps so that we can share that code between those components 
            instead of having to copy and paste it.)
        d. Working with Forms
        e. How to incorporate concepts from functional programming into our react apps.
